   abstract = {In machine learning, active learning refers to algorithms that autonomously select the data points from which they will learn. There are many data mining applications in which large amounts of unlabeled data are readily available, but labels (e.g., human annotations or results coming from complex experiments) are costly to obtain. In such scenarios, an active learning algorithm aims at identifying data points that, if labeled and used for training, would most improve the learned model. Labels are then obtained only for the most promising data points. This speeds up learning and reduces labeling costs. Support vector machine (SVM) classifiers are particularly well-suited for active learning due to their convenient mathematical properties. They perform linear classification, typically in a kernel-induced feature space, which makes expressing the distance of a data point from the decision boundary straightforward. Furthermore, heuristics can efficiently help estimate how strongly learning from a data point influences the current model. This information can be used to actively select training samples. After a brief introduction to the active learning problem, we discuss different query strategies for selecting informative data points and review how these strategies give rise to different variants of active learning with SVMs. For further resources related to this article, please visit the WIREs website.

   abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) have recently been achieving state-of-the-art performance on a variety of pattern-recognition tasks, most notably visual classification problems. Given that DNNs are now able to classify objects in images with near-human-level performance, questions naturally arise as to what differences remain between computer and human vision. A recent study [30] revealed that changing an image (e.g. of a lion) in a way imperceptible to humans can cause a DNN to label the image as something else entirely (e.g. mislabeling a lion a library). Here we show a related result: it is easy to produce images that are completely unrecognizable to humans, but that state-of-the-art DNNs believe to be recognizable objects with 99.99% confidence (e.g. labeling with certainty that white noise static is a lion). Specifically, we take convolutional neu-ral networks trained to perform well on either the ImageNet or MNIST datasets and then find images with evolutionary algorithms or gradient ascent that DNNs label with high confidence as belonging to each dataset class. It is possible to produce images totally unrecognizable to human eyes that DNNs believe with near certainty are familiar objects, which we call "fooling images" (more generally, fooling examples). Our results shed light on interesting differences between human vision and current DNNs, and raise questions about the generality of DNN computer vision.},

   abstract = {Despite the power of deep neural networks for a wide range of tasks, an overconfident prediction issue has limited their practical use in many safety-critical applications. Many recent works have been proposed to mitigate this issue, but most of them require either additional computational costs in training and/or inference phases or customized architectures to output confidence estimates separately. In this paper, we propose a method of training deep neural networks with a novel loss function, named Correctness Ranking Loss, which regularizes class probabilities explicitly to be better confidence estimates in terms of ordinal ranking according to confidence. The proposed method is easy to implement and can be applied to the existing architectures without any modification. Also, it has almost the same computational costs for training as conventional deep classifiers and outputs reliable predictions by a single inference. Extensive experimental results on classification benchmark datasets indicate that the proposed method helps networks to produce well-ranked confidence estimates. We also demonstrate that it is effective for the tasks closely related to confidence estimation, out-of-distribution detection and active learning.},

   abstract = {Empirical evidences linking users’ psychological features such as personality traits and cybercrimes such as cyberbullying are many. This study deals with automatic cyberbullying detection mechanism tapping into Twitter users’ psychological features including personalities, sentiment and emotion. User personalities were determined using Big Five and Dark Triad models, whereas machine learning classifiers namely, Naïve Bayes, Random Forest and J48 were used to classify the tweets into one of four categories: bully, aggressor, spammer and normal. The Twitter dataset contained 5453 tweets gathered using the hashtag #Gamergate, and manually annotated by human experts. Selected Twitter-based features namely text, user and network-based features were used as the baseline algorithm. Results show that cyberbullying detection improved when personalities and sentiments were used, however, a similar effect was not observed for emotion. A further analysis on the personalities revealed extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism and psychopathy to have greater impacts in detecting online bullying compared to other traits. Key features were identified using the dimension reduction technique, and integrated into a single model, which produced the best detection accuracy. The paper describes suggestions and recommendations as to how the findings can be applied to mitigate cyberbullying.},

   abstract = {<p>The advent of social media, particularly Twitter, raises many issues due to a misunderstanding regarding the concept of freedom of speech. One of these issues is cyberbullying, which is a critical global issue that affects both individual victims and societies. Many attempts have been introduced in the literature to intervene in, prevent, or mitigate cyberbullying; however, because these attempts rely on the victims’ interactions, they are not practical. Therefore, detection of cyberbullying without the involvement of the victims is necessary. In this study, we attempted to explore this issue by compiling a global dataset of 37,373 unique tweets from Twitter. Moreover, seven machine learning classifiers were used, namely, Logistic Regression (LR), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Random Forest (RF), AdaBoost (ADB), Naive Bayes (NB), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Each of these algorithms was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score as the performance metrics to determine the classifiers’ recognition rates applied to the global dataset. The experimental results show the superiority of LR, which achieved a median accuracy of around 90.57%. Among the classifiers, logistic regression achieved the best F1 score (0.928), SGD achieved the best precision (0.968), and SVM achieved the best recall (1.00).</p>},

   abstract = {Automatic cyberbullying detection is a task of growing interest, particularly in the Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning communities. Not only is it challenging, but it is also a relevant need given how social networks have become a vital part of individuals' lives and how dire the consequences of cyberbullying can be, especially among adolescents. In this work, we conduct an in-depth analysis of 22 studies on automatic cyberbullying detection, complemented by an experiment to validate current practices through the analysis of two datasets. Results indicated that cyberbullying is often misrepresented in the literature, leading to inaccurate systems that would have little real-world application. Criteria concerning cyberbullying definitions and other methodological concerns seem to be often dismissed. Additionally, there is no uniformity regarding the methodology to evaluate said systems and the natural imbalance of datasets remains an issue. This paper aims to direct future research on the subject towards a viewpoint that is more coherent with the definition and representation of the phenomenon, so that future systems can have a practical and impactful application. Recommendations on future works are also made.},

Cyberbullying may cause many serious and negative impacts on a person's life and even lead to teen suicide. To reduce and stop cyberbullying, one effective solution is to automatically detect bullying content based on appropriate machine learning and natural language processing techniques. However, many existing approaches in the literature are just normal text classification models without considering bullying characteristics. In this paper, we propose a representation learning framework specific to cyberbullying detection. Based on word embeddings, we expand a list of pre-defined insulting words and assign different weights to obtain bullying features, which are then concatenated with Bag-of-Words and latent semantic features to form the final representation before feeding them into a linear SVM classifier. Experimental study on a twitter dataset is conducted, and our method is compared with several baseline text representation learning models and cyberbullying detection methods. The superior performance achieved by our method has been observed in this study.},

Machine learning techniques make automatic detection of bullying messages in social media possible, and this could help to construct a healthy and safe social media environment. In this meaningful research area, one critical issue is robust and discriminative numerical representation learning of text messages. In this paper, we propose a new representation learning method to tackle this problem. Our method named semantic-enhanced marginalized denoising auto-encoder (smSDA) is developed via semantic extension of the popular deep learning model stacked denoising autoencoder (SDA). The semantic extension consists of semantic dropout noise and sparsity constraints, where the semantic dropout noise is designed based on domain knowledge and the word embedding technique. Our proposed method is able to exploit the hidden feature structure of bullying information and learn a robust and discriminative representation of text. Comprehensive experiments on two public cyberbullying corpora ( Twitter and MySpace) are conducted, and the results show that our proposed approaches outperform other baseline text representation learning methods.},

With the growth trends of heterogeneous data in OSN, better network characterization, and textual feature sophistication, recent efforts have realized the value of looking at heterogeneous modes of information including textual features, social features, and image-based features for better cyberbullying detection. These approaches, however, still use these features either individually or combine them 'naively' without considering the different confidence levels associated with each feature or the interdependencies between features. We propose a novel probabilistic information fusion framework that utilizes confidence score and interdependencies associated with different social and textual features and uses those to build better predictors for cyberbullying.
